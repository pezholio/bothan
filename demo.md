You can see a demo version with some pre-prepared metrics at [https://demo.bothan.io](https://demo.bothan.io).

To add your own metrics, follow the steps in the [API documentation](/api), using the username `username` and the password `password`. The database is reset every day at 7am UTC.

You can also build your own dashboard by going to [http://demo.bothan.io/dashboards/new]( http://demo.bothan.io/dashboards/new) and logging in with the same details (username `username` / password `password`).
