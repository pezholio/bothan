<p>Simply click the button below to deploy your own free Bothan instance to Heroku (requires a free Heroku account, but you'll be walked through the process if you don't).

<p><a href="https://deploy.bothan.io"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="deploy" /></a></p>

Your instance will come with a free <a href="https://mlab.com/">mLab</a> sandbox database, enough to store around 500,000 metrics. This can be upgraded any time via Heroku.</p>
